# Roadmap

## Prometeo currently:

* Gathers temperature, humidity, and smoke data and sends that data to the IBM Cloud for processing
* Processes the data through a custom machine learning algorithm to predict firefighter health from the live condition
* Stores data collected for long-term analysis of firefighter health
* Visualizes data through a dashboard (which is currently being refactored)

## Within the next months we are aiming to do:

- [ ] Monitor more data with additional sensors or wearables (bands and shirts)
- [ ] Explore hardware options to improve performance and range
- [ ] Create more capability in the dashboard

## Longer term goals are:

- [ ] Wider rollout of Prometeo solutions to firefighters all over the world
- [ ] Explore options for edge processing (offline first, centralized device configuration)
